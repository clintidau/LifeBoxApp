<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h3>

<p>Have you ever wished you could remember what was said in a forgotten conversation? Do you need a simple way to record meetings at work, or lectures at school? Would you like to hear yourself snoring at night?</p>

<p>LifeBoxApp is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelog">lifelogging</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sousveillance">sousveillance</a> app for your Android device that captures audio 24/7 and uploads it to your personal Dropbox account. <i>On some Android devices, LifeBoxApp may prevent other apps from using your microphone while it is recording.</i></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/clintidau/LifeBoxPlayer">LifeBoxPlayer</a> is a <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/">Java</a> application for Mac/Linux/Windows that helps you to decrypt and review your recordings.</p>

<h3>
<a id="security" class="anchor" href="#security" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Security</h3>

<p>Your recordings are protected with SSL during the upload to Dropbox. You can optionally set a password to encrypt recordings with AES before they are uploaded. Recordings are <i>not</i> encrypted while they exist on your Android device or on your PC, so we recommend enabling Android device encryption, and encrypting your PC hard disk with FileVault (Mac), LUKS (Linux), BitLocker (Windows) or VeraCrypt (Windows without BitLocker).</p>

<h3>
<a id="privacy-policy" class="anchor" href="#privacy-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>We do not collect any data other than the anonymous analytics collected by Google Play, GitHub, and Dropbox.</p>

<h3>
<a id="usage-agreement" class="anchor" href="#usage-agreement" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage Agreement</h3>

<p>Before downloading or using LifeBoxApp you must agree to comply with your local laws regarding the recording of other people. In most places you must ask permission before recording other people, or notify them that they are being recorded.</p>

<p>For example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_Devices_Act_2007_(NSW)">Surveillance Devices Act 2007</a> (NSW, Australia), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda2007210/s7.html">Section 7</a>:<br /><i>A person must not knowingly install, use or cause to be used or maintain a listening device to overhear, record, monitor or listen to a private conversation to which the person is not a party, or to record a private conversation to which the person is a party. This does not apply if a principal party to the conversation consents to the listening device being so used and the recording of the conversation is reasonably necessary for the protection of the lawful interests of that principal party, or is not made for the purpose of communicating or publishing the conversation, or a report of the conversation, to persons who are not parties to the conversation</i>.
